Real-Time Interactive Guide to AMQP
===================================

**Technology used**: AMQP 0-9-1 and KAAZING Gateway. While this guide assumes that you have an AMQP 0-9-1 broker and the Gateway running locally, you can also use a RFC-6455 WebSocket endpoint that supports AMQP 0-9-1 instead of the Gateway.

An interactive guide is included in the KAAZING Gateway JavaScript AMQP demo available at [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org). The demo and guide are also available in the JavaScript AMQP Client library available at [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org) To use the Real-Time Interactive Guide to AMQP:

1.  Download or fork the KAAZING Gateway JavaScript AMQP demo available at [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org).
2.  Download or fork the KAAZING Gateway available at [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org).
3.  Download an AMQP Message broker, such as Apache Qpid.
